## Description

Farmer John has received a noise complaint from his neighbor, Farmer Bob, stating that his cows are making too much noise.

FJ's N cows (1 <= N <= 10,000) all graze at various locations on a long one-dimensional pasture. The cows are very chatty animals. Every pair of cows simultaneously carries on a conversation (so every cow is simultaneously MOOing at all of the N-1 other cows). When cow i MOOs at cow j, the volume of this MOO must be equal to the distance between i and j, in order for j to be able to hear the MOO at all. Please help FJ compute the total volume of sound being generated by all N * (N-1) simultaneous MOOing sessions.

## Input

* Line 1: N 
* Lines 2 .. (N + 1): The location of each cow (in the range 0 .. 1,000,000,000).

## Output

There are five cows at locations 1, 5, 3, 2, and 4.

## Hint

* INPUT DETAILS:
There are five cows at locations 1, 5, 3, 2, and 4.
* OUTPUT DETAILS:
Cow at 1 contributes 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, cow at 5 contributes 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10, cow at 3 contributes 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6, cow at 2 contributes 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7, and cow at 4 contributes 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7. The total volume is (10 + 10 + 6 + 7 + 7) = 40.
